# Elastick adapter

Connect vintage joysticks (Apple 2, Atari, CoCo...) to your modern PC via Bluetooth.

Elastick is a hardware and software project using the ESP32-based Lolin D32 to interface with classic joysticks. These devices are detected as Bluetooth input peripherals and can be used with emulators like MAME or any modern game using game controllers.

## Folders

- **code**: arduino code (I used arduino IDE v2)
- **3d**: resources for 3D printing
- **elec**: kicad project for PCB
- **resources**: various pictures

## Known issues

- The rotary button does not work perfectly. It's unclear whether this is due to a hardware limitation or a software issue that could be resolved in code.

- The Lolin board draws a significant amount of current when Bluetooth is initialized, which can cause a reboot at that exact moment if the power supply is insufficient. A capacitor has been added to reduce the risk, and while it improves stability, the issue may still occur during Bluetooth startup.
